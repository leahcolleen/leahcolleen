## Skills

#### Self-led learner and problem solver (growth mindset)
Since completing an introductory web development course with Code First Girls, I have continued to learn and develop my skills in HTML and CSS, Ruby and JavaScript as a student in the Makers Academy. Being able to problem solve has been very important in my learning journey when I stumble on a problem and need further assistance. Having a growth mindset when approaching these problems has become essential in my learning journey; being able to accept the challenge and know that with persistence and determination I will learn new concepts coding problems may introduce. Today there are lots of solutions online and I have learnt to use my initiative to use websites like Bootstrap, W3schools and tech forums to aid my learning.

<!-- #### Time management and organisation
Developing my skills alone has meant I have to be strict with managing my time and prioritising tasks in my daily life. I have to make sure I set aside time to code alongside my part-time job. -->

#### Teamwork and collaboration (EQ)
I am a strong independent worker but also enjoy working in collaborative teams, which allows me to gain and share new information. In collaborative work I am effective in communicating verbally and in writing. Throughtout my time at the Makers Academy, I worked in teams of 3 to 6 team members building web applications. The group projects were based on the agile working model and I gained experience using typical agile processes such as morning stand-ups, end-of-day retros, continuous integretion and continuous deployment. To effectively work in teams it was important to know and understand each team member's working style to avoid conflict and promote efficiency.
