## Skills
<!-- #### Self-led learner and problem solver (growth mindset)
Since completing an introductory web development course with Code First Girls, I have continued to learn and develop my skills in HTML and CSS using Free Code Camp and The Odin Project online resources. Being able to problem solve has been very important in my learning process, because there has been cases when I am stuck on a step and need further assistance. So to solve this I often use Google to find my answers on websites like Bootstrap, W3schools and tech forums. Developing my skills alone has meant I have to be strict with managing my time and prioritising tasks in my daily life. I have to make sure I set aside time to code alongside my part-time job. Thi skill was further developed as a student in the Makers Academy
#### Time management and organisation

#### Teamwork and collaboration (EQ)
I am a strong independent worker but also enjoy working in collaborative teams, which allows me to gain and share new information. In collaborative work I am effective in communicating verbally and in writing. Throughtout my time at the Makers Academy, I worked in teams of 3 to 6 team members building web applications. The group projects were based on the agile working model and I gained experience using typical agile processes such as morning stand-ups, end-of-day retros, continuous integretion and continuous deployment.
